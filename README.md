# Summary

GujTB is an in-progress treebank of Gujarati (an Indo-Aryan language) in Gujarati script.

# Introduction

Currently the treebank is comprised of 187 sentences, out of which 100 are doubly annotated by the authors. We plan to update the treebank with proper morphological annotations and features in the upcoming release.

    abstract = "The Universal Dependencies (UD) project has presented itself as a valuable platform to develop various resources for the languages of the world. We present and release a sample treebank for the Indo-Aryan language of Gujarati {--} a widely spoken language with little linguistic resources. This treebank is the first labeled dataset for dependency parsing in the language and the script (the Gujarati script). The treebank contains 187 part-of-speech and dependency annotated sentences from diverse genres. We discuss various idiosyncratic examples, annotation choices and present an elaborate corpus along with agreement statistics. We see this work as a valuable resource and a stepping stone for research in Gujarati Computational Linguistics.",
